Polymorphism

Inheritance
    Reuse
        Copy->Duplicate
        Window 95-> Window XP

Inheritance-> Code Reuse  
           -> Add Functionality
           -> Structuring Code
           -> Design
           -> Work in Conjuction with Polymorphism      

Should learn Object Oriented Analysis And Design

Shape->Rect-> CompositeShape

if (drawingTool == rect)
{
    drawRect();
}
else if( drawingTool == circle)
{
    drawCircle
}

To make Polymorphism
-Create Base Class
-Create child Class 
-Overwrite base Functionality in child
-Use parent reference to call child method-> henece Polymorphism

//Concrete class, =>used to create Object
//Abstract class=> cannot used to create object class, just used for base class
